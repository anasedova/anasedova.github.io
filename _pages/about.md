I am a fourth-year PhD student in the NLP Lab, a part of [Data Mining and Machine Learning Research Group ](https://dm.cs.univie.ac.at) at 
the University of Vienna, where I am advised by [Ben Roth](https://www.benjaminroth.net), 
working on machine learning and natural language processing. 
Previously, I completed my M.Sc. degrees in Computational Linguistics and Computer Science in the 
[Center for Information and Language Processing](https://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/) 
at [LMU Munich](https://www.lmu.de/en/index.html) with a full scholarship from the 
[German Academic Exchange Service](https://www.daad.de/en/).

My research interests include (but not limited to) noisy and low-resource learning and model explainability and trustworthiness.
