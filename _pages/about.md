I am a final-year PhD student in the NLP Lab at the University of Vienna, [Data Mining and Machine Learning Research Group](https://dm.cs.univie.ac.at), where I am advised by [Ben Roth](https://www.benjaminroth.net), working on machine learning and natural language processing. 
Currently, I'm interning at Machine Learning Research team at Apple under supervision of [Maartje Ter Hoeve](https://maartjeth.github.io) and [Natalie Schluter](https://natschluter.github.io). 

Previously, I completed my M.Sc. degrees in Computational Linguistics and Computer Science in the [Center for Information and Language Processing](https://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/) at [LMU Munich](https://www.lmu.de/en/index.html) with a full scholarship from the 
[German Academic Exchange Service](https://www.daad.de/en/).

My research interests include (but not limited to) model explainability and trustworthiness as well as noisy and low-resource learning.
